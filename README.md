## Abstract

Crime and violence trace back to the beginning of human history.
Our project utilizes publicly available data to analyze certain aspects
of crime in the city of Los Angeles, California in the time period
between January 2010 and September 2017. By visualizing those
aspects, this project depicts certain trends that can be used to raise
awareness among Los Angeles, California civic, and ultimately
decrease crime rates in certain communities and city areas.
